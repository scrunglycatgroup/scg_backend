# SCG backend

This repo is for the server backend work

## Plans
### Current Goals
- [ ] HTTP REST API 
- [ ] LLM Code (in progress)
- [ ] Document the whole thing
- [ ] Containerize it 
- [ ] Anything else to get it to work best on either Viking or personal computers

This is still very very in production, so lots to do just getting something out asap will work on this a lot soon!
This is where I am getting the basis for some of the code for running the NN
